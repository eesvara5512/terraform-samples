# Terraform Remote Backend

Terraform [remote](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/remote.html) backend helps users
store Terraform [state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and run Terraform commands
remotely using [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html).

> Note: CDK for Terraform only supports Terraform Cloud workspaces that have "[Execution Mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/settings.html#execution-mode)" set to "local". The project doesn't support remote operations yet. To change the execution mode for a Terraform Cloud workspace, visit the "General" setting tab in the workspace and find "Execution Mode" section, select "local" and save the settings.

A Terraform [JSON configuration for a remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html#terraform-blocks)
can be defined in two ways:

1. Use a TerraformBackend subclass to define a backend. It will synthesize
   to a JSON configuration in the autogenerated `cdk.tf.json` file.

   ```typescript
   const stack = new MyStack(app, "hello-terraform");
   new RemoteBackend(stack, {
     hostname: "app.terraform.io",
     organization: "company",
     workspaces: {
       name: "my-app-prod",
     },
   });
   ```

2. Create a JSON file such as `remote.tf.json` in `cdktf.out` sub directory depending on your stack. So e.g. for the stack `hello-terraform` it would be `cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform/remote.tf.json`.

The `cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform` directory contains our synthesized code that can be generated by running `cdktf synth` in
any CDK for Terraform project.

```bash
cd cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform
vim remote.tf.json
```

```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "remote": {
        "hostname": "app.terraform.io",
        "organization": "company",
        "workspaces": {
          "name": "my-app-prod"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stack output directory is as follows.

```bash
tree .
.
├── cdk.tf.json
└── remote.tf.json
```

Running `terraform init` will initialize Terraform remote backend.

```shell
$ terraform init
```

Users can then run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to manage their infrastructure.

## Migrating Local State Storage to Remote

When migrating a project that is using local storage (`terraform.tfstate` file) to store the state of the project to remote state store like Terraform Cloud, users need to define move the Terraform state file to the CDK for Terraform output directory.

Here is a project called `hello-terraform` that is using local storage to store the Terraform state.

```bash
cd hello-terraform
```

Add remote state backend using TerraformBackend.

```bash
vim main.ts
```

```typescript
const stack = new MyStack(app, "hello-terraform");
new RemoteBackend(stack, {
  hostname: "app.terraform.io",
  organization: "company",
  workspaces: {
    name: "my-app-prod",
  },
});
```

Synthesize application

```bash
cdktf synth
```

Move Terraform state file into the output directory.

```bash
mv terraform.hello-terraform.tfstate cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform
```

Run Terraform init

```bash
cd cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform
terraform init


Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "remote" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "remote" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "remote"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes


Successfully configured the backend "remote"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...

.....
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

```

Validate state migration by running the `cdktf diff` command in the root `hello-terraform`

```bash
cd ../../..
```

```bash
cdktf diff
```

There are no changes to the stack.

```bash
Stack: hello-terraform

Diff: 0 to create, 0 to update, 0 to delete.

```

## Escape Hatches

Unsupported backends can be configured via a [Stack Escape Hatch](./escape-hatch.md).

```typescript
stack.addOverride("terraform.backend", {
  atlas: {
    name: "example_corp/networking-prod",
    address: "https://app.terraform.io",
  },
});
```

Escaped hatches can also be used on backend constructs.

```typescript
const backend = new RemoteBackend(stack, {...});
backend.addOverride('organization', 'my_other_company');
```
